You have two datasets from the same assessment, but the kobo tool was changed slightly between the two.
Use the "merge_kobo_data" function from the IMPACT R package "mergekobodata" to combine them into as single data set.
send the result to martin.barner@impact-initiatives.org


Tip: A good search pattern to find csv files could be ".csv" !
