Considering the goal to have people with the skills to build tools in each mission, some people might need more training than others (in the future, after the RCM).

12.02.2019 08:39:15,a question,not session specific,"I am wondering how we can transfer the knowledge we aquire here into our missions. I am sure people learn a lot and gain some insights on how to make their own work more efficient/analysis better/etc., but if it's only one person per mission learning this, the gap between this group and the others will just increase. I think we should think of a way on how to bring other AOs/coordination-focused people to a certain level so that they can actually use the tools. At the moment, I can't really see how we could do that (specifically in our mission, where the basic technical level in not bad, but there's no real experts that could push to get everyone further).

Getting to know GitHub was great and I will start implementing it in all my R projects now.

13.02.2019 11:30:24,feedback,not session specific,"This is a very valuable training! Some things about it: 
-it was not too task- specific, so just allowed to conceptualize, explore guidelines, understand general principles of how to look for solution and how to debug the bug
-it was an amazing opportunity to meet people from the other missions, learn from them, enrich own perspective
-i think it is very hardcore for the trainer to be the only trainer during all three days, expecially taking into account that this is a pilot
-it was nice that feedback was implemented almost instantly, so that finally we can do/try everything we wanted to
-it was very inspirational! Bravo

13.02.2019 11:34:17,feedback,not session specific,"I think overall this has been a good training. I liked the practical exercises particularly. Overall, it was a good introduction to existing R tools and how to generally load/run/troubleshoot R scripts etc. and should enable participants to use existing tools at least (which I guess was the intention of this, so, goal achieved). I think it could've been a bit more structured at times (the general structure was probably useful but we did jump a bit between different things on the first day). I also would have liked more practical exercises and personally felt it could have been a bit more challenging. Maybe it could have been good to have a specific output as a desired result of a multiple-step process involving multiple tools and eventually leading to a brief analysis of a few hypotheses or indicators. Maybe also could've been good to have a few small tasks for people to try out with their own data, e.g. aggregate data at a higher admin level, group data by population group or region, create a visualisation for one of these etc. (just with a few lines of code everyone could do on their own). I get that we had different skill levels and limited time so maybe not completely feasible but just wanted to bring it up as it could have helped people to have a few more experiences of success/progression and maybe a bit more insight into coding.",3,0,0,4,2,0
